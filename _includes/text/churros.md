In early 2023, we set ourselves the goal of developing the ENSEEIHT student application. Thus was born "Churros", a kind of social network developed by a team of 10 people in Svelte, Typescript and PLpgSQL. Development began in the summer of 2023, with the aim of having the application up and running by September. I'm still part of the ongoing development team for this application, which is updated on a regular basis.
